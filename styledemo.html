			A short story is a piece of prose fiction that typically can be read in one 
sitting and focuses on a self-contained incident or series of linked 
incidents, with the intent of evoking a single effect or mood. 
The short story is one of the oldest types of literature and has 
existed in the form of legends, mythic tales, folk tales, fairy tales, 
fables and anecdotes in various ancient communities across the world. 
The modern short story developed in the early 19th century.
"A Good Man is Hard to Find" by Flannery O'Connor
O'Connor delivers an unsettling, satirical story of a family road trip gone 
horribly awry. When a grandmother tries to direct the family to her 
childhood home, she actually leads them right into the clutches of The 
Misfit, a dangerous character that will stick with you long after the last 
sentence.
