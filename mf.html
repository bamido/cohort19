"A Good Man is Hard to Find" by Flannery O'Connor
O'Connor delivers an unsettling, satirical story of a family road trip gone 
horribly awry. When a grandmother tries to direct the family to her 
childhood home, she actually leads them right into the clutches of The 
Misfit, a dangerous character that will stick with you long after the last 
sentence.
